10:00am commit | Figuring out how to put state in capstone

11:00am commit | Mess of time with state. Will be doing vidoes, reading old code, commiting only for record.

12:30pm | Having a terrible time to sort through projects and grasp some concepts again. I am writing in here because i thought i would be working in several different files repos today. I wanted to make sure and have a single repo for a commit history. Good thing too, because i have erased my entire repo locally and recloned to start over. Will keep checking in here. 


1:20pm | Finally making some progress here. Added constants for masterProductList, and exported that and TYPES out through the index module. 

2:13 | Chipping away on a new branch in my capstone. Working on selcting a product and opening model with correct data

3:05 | Still trucking away. I have spent the entire day trying to piece together this concept of capturing the click event and updating the state on the selected item. I am going to have to make myself a lesson with just state on a single item to see how this works. 

4:05 |  checkin in again | Can't figure out if i even need state. Will see if i can talk to someone on the phone tomorrow

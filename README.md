This repo is merely a means to check in for attendance purposes. The notes are just a little extra documentation, not anything that should be looked over by anyone else. ;-)

10:00am commit | Figuring out how to put state in capstone

11:00am commit | Mess of time with state. Will be doing videos, reading old code, committing only for record.

12:30pm | Having a terrible time to sort through projects and grasp some concepts again. I am writing in here because i thought i would be working in several different files repos today. I wanted to make sure and have a single repo for a commit history. Good thing too, because i have erased my entire repo locally and recloned to start over. Will keep checking in here.


1:20pm | Finally making some progress here. Added constants for masterProductList, and exported that and TYPES out through the index module.

2:13 | Chipping away on a new branch in my capstone. Working on selecting a product and opening model with correct data

3:05 | Still trucking away. I have spent the entire day trying to piece together this concept of capturing the click event and updating the state on the selected item. I am going to have to make myself a lesson with just state on a single item to see how this works.

4:05 |  checkin in again | Can't figure out if i even need state. Will see if i can talk to someone on the phone tomorrow

5:00 pm | I emailed you a bit ago as well, so I will keep this brief. I will have additional commits in capstone because I am making a little bit of progress now. Finally!!!


# Thursday

9:12am | Exploring some different concepts on building a Modal with images. I will spend the next couple hours watching a couple videos, and reading some articles on how to actually get this done. Will probably look up a couple pre made components as well, although, I have done all styling with standard CSS so far, so I might just do that throughout as a way to understand how things work for future projects.

10:30am | Creating a modal component to display all product details and cart option.

11:44 | Styling modal in capstone

1:00pm | Working on capstone modal still. Focused on how to display the correct image when someone clicks on a product.

2:30pm | Working on modals. Have additional commits in other repo

3:30 | Working on trying to implement unknown props populating the modal

4:15 | Looks like this took a turn for the worst. Some products have all kinds of information that others don't have. This will make it difficult to have a single model, and how to populate it with all of the extra information. Perhaps creating an array of strings, and looping through it and displaying a list item for each.

6:38 | Still going. Going to cook and make dinner now.    


9:00 | started morning with a kirupa video. Planned to work more on capstone. Guess I better look at Friday project too.  

10:15am | Building a AbouUs component in capstone

12:30pm | Styling about us. Making repsonsive

1:45pm | Styling away. Learning better ways to make this reposnisve

2:35 | 8 media queries later and it looks about complete. Lol. Not surer how normal this is.

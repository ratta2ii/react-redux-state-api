10:00am commit | Figuring out how to put state in capstone

11:00am commit | Mess of time with state. Will be doing vidoes, reading old code, commiting only for record.

12:30pm | Having a terrible time to sort through projects and grasp some concepts again. I am writing in here because i thought i would be working in several different files repos today. I wanted to make sure and have a single repo for a commit history. Good thing too, because i have erased my entire repo locally and recloned to start over. Will keep checking in here. 


1:20pm | Finally making some progress here. Added constants for masterProductList, and exported that and TYPES out through the index module. 

2:13 | Chipping away on a new branch in my capstone. Working on selcting a product and opening model with correct data
